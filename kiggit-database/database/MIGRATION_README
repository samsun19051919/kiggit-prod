Info on migrations.

To create a migration (some kind of change in db) you need to
run ./create-migration.sh <FILE_NAME>

This will create a file in the migration folder which you can edit
to suit your needs.


Then run

./list-migrations.sh <CONFIG_PROFILE> e.g. ./list-migrations.sh test

to assure that your migration is pending for appliance to db. All
migrations that are not applied is marked 'No'.


Run

./apply-migrations <CONFIG_PROFILE> e.g. ./apply-migrations.sh test

to apply changes to the database.


Finally run

./list-migrations.sh <CONFIG_PROFILE> e.g. ./list-migrations.sh test

to check if all expected migrations is marked 'Yes'.
